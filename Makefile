# force the Helm 3 to use the .work/helm directory. This causes Go on Linux
# machines to use that directory as the build cache as well. We should adjust
# this behavior in the build submodule because it is also causing Linux users
# to duplicate their build cache, but for now we just make it easier to identify
# its location in CI so that we cache between builds.
